# MyMCPS Plus (Plus)
@ForrestFire0 and @mattm6800 wanted to build a multiplatform, student to-do list, encompassing the assignments from google classroom and mymcps classroom (beginning with @AnuragGowda's work to understand the processes).
We decided to suspend working on this project after learning an education company (whom we needed approval to use their service) is releasing an educational product that makes our project obsolete.
However, we are proud of our work and it may be useful for someone trying to understand the Flask Framework and the Oauth 2.0 authentication process.
